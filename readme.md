# scommit

## What?
### What isn't this?
* This is not a spell checker for git
* This is not a replacement for writing commit messages in a terminal

### Who is this for?
* This is for people which suck at spelling but think opening up a editor to write a commit message is fucking stupid
* This is for people who want to know when something is misspelt but don't want recommendations

## Installing
Build with `go build .` then copy the program into your bin as `git-scommit`

## Using
`git scommit YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE` I haven't tested with " it's not worth it all args will be treated as the message.
